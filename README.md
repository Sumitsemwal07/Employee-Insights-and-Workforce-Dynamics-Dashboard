## Objective
To demonstrate a real-world HR analytics workflow — from raw data cleaning to insight-driven dashboarding — using Excel, Power Query, and Power Pivot.

## Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Excel
- Power Query (data cleaning & transformation)  
- Power Pivot & DAX (calculations and KPIs)
- Pivot Tables & Slicers 

## Dataset
- Simulated HR dataset (2008–2024)
- Includes employee demographics, department, role, performance, engagement, workload, overtime, and attrition status

## Dashboard Highlights
- Workforce distribution by department  
- Employee performance distribution  
- Average performance score by department  
- Engagement vs weekly work hours analysis  
- Attrition rate analysis by overtime and engagement  

## Key KPIs
- Total Employees  
- Average Salary & Performance Score
- Average Engagement Score & Weekly Work Hours  
- Cumulative Attrition Rate  

## Workflow Summary
Raw data → Power Query cleaning → Power Pivot modeling → Pivot-based dashboard 

## Notes
- Data is simulated and used for learning and portfolio demonstration.
- Some expected linear patterns (e.g., Attrition rate% by engagement level, Weekly work hours by engagement level) are not consistently observed, which reflects real-world data limitations and the influence of untracked factors. Insights should be interpreted as exploratory, not causal.
